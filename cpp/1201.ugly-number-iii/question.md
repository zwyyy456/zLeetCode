# [1201. Ugly Number III][link] (Medium)

[link]: https://leetcode.com/problems/ugly-number-iii/

An **ugly number** is a positive integer that is divisible by `a`, `b`, or `c`.

Given four integers `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c`, return the `nᵗʰ` **ugly number**.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: n = 3, a = 2, b = 3, c = 5
Output: 4
Explanation: The ugly numbers are 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10... The 3ʳᵈ is 4.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: n = 4, a = 2, b = 3, c = 4
Output: 6
Explanation: The ugly numbers are 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12... The 4ᵗʰ is 6.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: n = 5, a = 2, b = 11, c = 13
Output: 10
Explanation: The ugly numbers are 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13... The 5ᵗʰ is 10.
```

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= n, a, b, c <= 10⁹`
- `1 <= a * b * c <= 10¹⁸`
- It is guaranteed that the result will be in range `[1, 2 * 10⁹]`.
