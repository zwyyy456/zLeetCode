# [1462. Course Schedule IV][link] (Medium)

[link]: https://leetcode.com/problems/course-schedule-iv/

There are a total of `numCourses` courses you have to take, labeled from `0` to `numCourses - 1`. You
are given an array `prerequisites` where `prerequisites[i] = [aᵢ, bᵢ]` indicates that you **must**
take course `aᵢ` first if you want to take course `bᵢ`.

- For example, the pair `[0, 1]` indicates that you have to take course `0` before you can take
course `1`.

Prerequisites can also be **indirect**. If course `a` is a prerequisite of course `b`, and course
`b` is a prerequisite of course `c`, then course `a` is a prerequisite of course `c`.

You are also given an array `queries` where `queries[j] = [uⱼ, vⱼ]`. For the `jᵗʰ` query, you should
answer whether course `uⱼ` is a prerequisite of course `vⱼ` or not.

Return _a boolean array_ `answer` _, where_ `answer[j]` _is the answer to the_ `jᵗʰ` _query._

**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/05/01/courses4-1-graph.jpg)

```
Input: numCourses = 2, prerequisites = [[1,0]], queries = [[0,1],[1,0]]
Output: [false,true]
Explanation: The pair [1, 0] indicates that you have to take course 1 before you can take course 0.
Course 0 is not a prerequisite of course 1, but the opposite is true.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: numCourses = 2, prerequisites = [], queries = [[1,0],[0,1]]
Output: [false,false]
Explanation: There are no prerequisites, and each course is independent.
```

**Example 3:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/05/01/courses4-3-graph.jpg)

```
Input: numCourses = 3, prerequisites = [[1,2],[1,0],[2,0]], queries = [[1,0],[1,2]]
Output: [true,true]
```

**Constraints:**

- `2 <= numCourses <= 100`
- `0 <= prerequisites.length <= (numCourses * (numCourses - 1) / 2)`
- `prerequisites[i].length == 2`
- `0 <= aᵢ, bᵢ <= n - 1`
- `aᵢ != bᵢ`
- All the pairs `[aᵢ, bᵢ]` are **unique**.
- The prerequisites graph has no cycles.
- `1 <= queries.length <= 10⁴`
- `0 <= uᵢ, vᵢ <= n - 1`
- `uᵢ != vᵢ`
