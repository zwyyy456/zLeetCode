# [653. Two Sum IV - Input is a BST][link] (Easy)

[link]: https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum-iv-input-is-a-bst/

Given the `root` of a binary search tree and an integer `k`, return `true`if there exist two
elements in the BST such that their sum is equal to `k`, or `false`otherwise.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: root = [5,3,6,2,4,null,7], k = 9
Output: true
```

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/09/21/sum_tree_2.jpg)

```
Input: root = [5,3,6,2,4,null,7], k = 28
Output: false
```

**Constraints:**

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[1, 10⁴]`.
- `-10⁴ <= Node.val <= 10⁴`
- `root` is guaranteed to be a **valid** binary search tree.
- `-10⁵ <= k <= 10⁵`
